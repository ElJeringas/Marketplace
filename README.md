# Marketplace

The following project, Marketplace, was created using Python as a primary programming language and Django as a framework. 
The project attempts to replicate the main functinalities of a marketplace site, such as:
* Login and Register
* Dashboard and Profile seller
* Adding, deleting and replacing items
* Searching among items, filtering and related products
* Messages between users

The frontend design was built using HTML and Tailwind, and the logic behind the functionality was written entirely using Python.
